This is the era of the First Flame-Chase Journey, an era with a scorching sun that burns with blinding light.And you must gaze directly into it, asking it to illuminate the fire you seek."

Beneath the sweet honey brew, though, salt and bitterness linger on the tongue.The higher the revelry soars, the less anyone notices the world below. That's the trick of it all.Only those who reach the absolute summit feel the sobering winds of truth. Then comes the inevitable fall. Salt, bitterness, vertigo, pain... all rushing up to embrace you as gravity collects its debt."
