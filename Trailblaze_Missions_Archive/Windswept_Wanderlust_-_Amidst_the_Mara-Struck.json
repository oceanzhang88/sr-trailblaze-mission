Is the Express really here just to help the Xianzhou Luofu solve the Stellaron problem? Yes. Why? (Trailblazer) Is it really that hard to understand why the Express is here? Can't someone act simply out of the kindness of their heart? What are you trying to say? (Trailblazer) Is it really that hard to understand why the Express is here? Can't someone act simply out of the kindness of their heart? Tingyun After all, people who help others without thinking of compensation or risks during the dangerous trips across the cosmos is rarer than air in vacuum When the higher-ups of Xianzhou first heard of your reasons for coming, they thought you were here either to seek immortality or the Stellaron... Seek immortality? (Trailblazer) Seeking immortality is absolutely forbidden on the Xianzhou, no? Tingyun Yes. As the home of long-life species , countless Elixir Seekers from all corners of the universe come to the Xianzhou to re-enact bygone histories and discover the secret of the Xianzhou residents' immortality Seek the Stellaron? (Trailblazer) Stellarons are the seeds of ruin. Why would the Express want the Stellaron? Tingyun But not everyone in the cosmos thinks this way. As a seed dispersed by an Aeon , some desire to obtain its power regardless of the cost Tingyun Apologies, I may have crossed the line. I don't know why I said all this I have absolute trust in your sincerity, benefactor, but the powerful masters are bound to think more than a pawn like me So, please be careful..."
