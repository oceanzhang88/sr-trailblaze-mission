Only when the starlit night shields you from sunlight, or when the Sun rises to melt away the morning frost, will you find relief. These present hardships will torture you forever, and no one can save you.But you have left behind the fire... the fire that will liberate them. And the fire meant to free you was illuminated long ago."
