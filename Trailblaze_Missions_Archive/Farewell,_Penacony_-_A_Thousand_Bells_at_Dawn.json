Is everyone flabbergasted yet? Weren't Miss Sparkle's buttons all confiscated already? Why is the bomb timer still active? Actually, all credit goes to our brave Hounds! Thanks to their meticulous efforts in gathering the buttons, Miss Sparkle was able to press all of them one by one~ Miss Sparkle's certainly worked her finger to the bone...

Of course, it was still down to Miss Sparkle's luck I don't know why, but there were a total of 16,537 esteemed Dreamchasers who volunteered to help Mistress Sparkle bear her burden... Girls who like to smile are always the ones with decent luck~ Anyway, the bomb Miss Sparkle placed on the cruise ship is hidden among 999 dolls You bright-eyed people will surely find where the real bomb is hidden. Good luck! \"From Where to View Fireworks\" has left the chat March 7th How many??? Himeko Don't panic. We'll deal with this together Robin Everyone, please don't make any commotion to cause unnecessary panic I will arrange for The Family members to prep for evac. But we'll still have to rely on you all to find and defuse the bomb The Oak Family has always relied on the strength of Order to guarantee everyone that \"death never occurs in dreams\" But the blessings of Order are now lost... Its consequences may be unimaginably detrimental Dan Heng I agree. If anyone finds anything, please update the group promptly. Argenti The Beauty is duty-bound! Topaz The IPC will lend our aid too.
