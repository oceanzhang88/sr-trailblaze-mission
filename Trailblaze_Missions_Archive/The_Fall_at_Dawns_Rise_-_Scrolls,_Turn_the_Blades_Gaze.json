She calmly responded to her most special student while scanning her surroundings. \"What is your floriography?\" \"I'm afraid I'm not a flower, but a tree.\" \"Hmm...\" Evidently, this answer failed to satisfy the other party. A sound mingled with dissatisfaction and disappointment reached her ears, prompting her to add another remark. \"Well, if we're just speaking metaphorically... I suppose it would be 'Intelligence.'\" However, her objective was nearly accomplished. It should be around here somewhere. Now, she just needed to find some bait to draw her out. \"...Intellectual, yet also romantic?\" \"Perhaps... it's because I... hibernate? You see, in my long dreams, I've made promises to countless lovers.\" \"...Really?\" The butterfly-winged girl suddenly rose from the thicket before Cerces, startling her slightly. After all, at this moment, the distance between them was virtually nonexistent. Gazing directly at Mnestia 's face, allowing the light reflecting from her lips to pass through her eyes, a hint of crimson flashed across Cerces' face — almost imperceptible to onlookers. Of course, her composure wavered for only a moment. Then, Cerces wrapped her arms around the girl's waist and, as if pulling up a radish from the ground, gently lifted her from the flower thicket. \"Of course not. Caught you now.\" Placing her on the ground, the giant tree's incarnation gently stroked the butterfly wings with the edges of her leaves, confirming the other's normal state before slowly withdrawing. \"So... now, will you tell me? Why have you been avoiding me?\" \"...\" \"Would you two please refrain from frolicking in my Antila Garden?\" A cold voice unseasonably interrupted their thoughts. Indeed, for the garden's master, the incarnation of death, such lively atmosphere was truly something akin to a natural enemy. \"Sorry... we'll leave at once. Thank you for listening to my troubles, Madam Thanatos. Cer, let's return to the Grove.\" \"Mm... sorry, Than, for troubling you.\" \"Honestly, you two are... alas. But, Cerces.\" \"...?\" \"...You must be aware by now, right?\" A bitter sensation spread in her mouth once more. Cerces remained silent, merely nodding as she bid farewell to her old friend. On the way back to the Grove, Mnestia remained completely silent. After one unsuccessful attempt to question her, Cerces struggled to find another opportunity to speak and simply focused on the path ahead. —Voices of gossip reached them, causing irritation. \"A genius... so what? She's just like...\" \"So terrifying...\" A stern figure approached rapidly — it was █████, the source of the irritation. Mnestia offered Cerces a smile, then turned and walked away. █████ cast a sharp glance in the direction of the butterfly-winged girl's departure, then shifted his gaze back to Cerces. First came perfunctory reports and spiritless small talk, then escalation to arguments that resembled personal attacks— \"Do you truly understand...\" \"I don't need to. Let me be direct, Cerces.\" \"To romance a student, even your own creation, don't you find that perverse—?\" \"Pow!\" This was the first time the embodiment of reason allowed emotions to govern her mind. The sensation left on her palm felt as if it would scorch through to the heart of the tree. From nearby came the sound of running footsteps — familiar yet somehow strange. Cerces wanted to give chase immediately, but the words echoing in her ears tripped her steps. She was indeed somewhat distracted, allowing the girl's image to surface and fade in her mind repeatedly. When her resolve crystallized, the third Curtain-Fall Hour had slipped by. The personification of the giant tree approached the gilded chrysalis, cried her beloved's name, then stilled, as if she had frozen. The traces left by the butterfly-winged girl who'd dwelled here were all but erased. Upon the foliate desk lay words: a maiden's first and final love letter. \"I love you, Cerces. I've already received the graduation gift after all. So, forget me.\""

The professor, barely over thirty, was leaning casually against the stone lectern, loose and relaxed. The scholar's robe gleamed bright in the dim light of the Evernight, giving off an almost divine aura. \"Hmm? The first class, and already late. Looks like someone is eager to meet Thanatos...\" In other words, this was our first one-on-one lesson and I just totally blew it from the start. Probably even Cerces would've felt embarrassed looking at such a sorry scene. Luckily, I had already come up with a plan— \"Sorry, professor! I'll do anything to make it up to you!\" \"Anything?\" \"Well... please, I hope you'll be lenient...\" At these words, the professor's face broke into a charming smile. \"Then, I want you to teach me.\" \"Wait, Professor...?\" \"I want you to break down the points in this paper, word by word, and explain them to me slowly.\" Although there was no mirror here, I could guess that my face had turned red from the sudden and direct request. \"Um, but... Professor... I'm still just a student intern. Isn't it... a bit too... early for me to do something like this?\" \"Hmph... I finally worked up the courage to say it! Do you want me to waste the lesson I prepared? You fool!\" \"At least... at least wait until after class!\" \"...If that's what you'd prefer, then fine. But don't forget, I still haven't forgiven you... So, what should we study first today?\" \"Why don't we peruse this academic journal? I think they recently published a paper on the patterns of natural numbers.\" \"Sounds good. Come on, let's have a look.\" The research paper was immensely valuable, but I couldn't even grasp the basic arguments, as I was too deeply engrossed in the professor's sharp gaze. He looked so rational when he was immersed in numbers. Nothing less than I'd expect from the professor I cherished so much. After that, we experienced an enriching lesson. We wandered through the classical literature exhibition, eagerly absorbing the newly compiled Titan Faith Studies. Finally, we lingered in the dreams woven by the latest works of the Erythrokeramism School, so much so that we completely forgot. The bell signaling the Curtain-Fall Hour rang, and we looked at each other. Class was over. More than once, I had resented time for its seemingly linear flow, yet I remained powerless to interfere with it. The professor looked at me and paused for a moment, as if making some kind of decision, then muttered: \"Take out your paper... I'll help you revise it.\" \"Really? You mean it?\" \"Yes. You are a student I take great pride in. I've been considering this for some time.\" \"Professor...\" \"Let me understand, your thoughts, your research, your... everything.\" No further words were needed. Two seekers of knowledge, driven by instinct, began their deep exploration of ideas. At that moment, we had yet to realize that after this lesson, another name would appear in the acknowledgments of the paper. And in the end, this would be the very spark that led to the founding of our academic symposium."

Brushing off the dust that had settled on him, he adjusted his attire and stood firm, facing the giant eagle in a tense standoff. \"Heh, so you think you're something special just because you defeated the silent Georios ? Mortal, heed my advice...\" The God-King remained silent, gazing into Aquila's thousand eyes. Slowly, he raised his right arm, four fingers pressed together, and with a simple motion, he lightly waved at the colossal being before him. \"Arrogant fool! You will pay the price for your insolence!\" Aquila's fury erupted, their towering form radiating intense heat. In an instant, their massive wings vibrated at an imperceptible speed! A thousand razor-sharp feathers shot forth like swords, hurtling straight toward the God-King! As everyone knows, the feathers of the Sky Titan can pierce through iron and steel, let alone mortal flesh. Their sheer density left no room to evade! The violent storm of lethal blades closed in, and time itself seemed to freeze! Aquila enhanced their reflexes, predicting the movements of this arrogant little thief before them. Noticing the God-King shifting his stance, Aquila mused, he had only two choices! He could push off the ground to evade left or right, or stand firm and brace for impact. But either way, it would be futile! The feathered blades would shift with the wind, altering their trajectory. No matter how swift his movements, they would follow him relentlessly! But who could have predicted, the God-King never intended to dodge! He pushed forward instead, seizing the first incoming feather blade between two fingers. With a swift turn, he carved a spiral through the air and hurled it back at supersonic speed. The feather blade curved with the wind, piercing deep into the storm. Without the slightest deviation, it collided tip-to-tip with another razor-sharp steel feather. \"Ding!\" The deflected feather veered to the sides upon impact, colliding with others and further altering their trajectories! \"Ding!!!\" The sharp clashing of feathers rang out in an irregular rhythm, a chain reaction unfolding until the force of the final feather was dissipated, scattering harmlessly into the air! With just a single seized feather, the God-King had nullified the entire storm of blade-like wings! Aquila was shocked! How could a mere mortal possess such divine skill? Yet, as a being of godly essence, they did not allow themself to be shaken. Seizing the moment as the scattered feathers clouded their vision, they swiftly brought down their claws, sharp as steel greatswords, aiming to end the battle in a single decisive strike! \"Boom!!\" The massive claw struck dead center where the God-King stood, the sheer force of impact carving a deep crater into the ground! No... something felt off. Aquila's mind raced, this sensation was strange... Had it missed? Or— They focused their gaze, only to witness the impossible. Their enormous, razor-sharp claw, many times larger than the God-King himself, was caught, held effortlessly in a single hand, as if the God-King were merely grasping a piece of cutlery! The countless white feathers drifting through the air painted an eerie contrast against the battlefield's deadly stillness. The once-mighty and untouchable giant eagle found itself frozen in shock, for the first time in a thousand years. Muttering in disbelief, they said: \"Impossible! Even Georios, when fighting me, could do nothing but evade beneath my iron claws, yet you... what in the world ARE you!!!\" \"Haven't you already figured out the answer? A mere mortal, nothing more.\" \"You cocky little—!!!\" Aquila attempted to retract their claw, but under the God-King's grip, it was as if frozen in place, completely immobile. Their expression darkened. Seeing this, the God-King seemed to smile. He clenched the fingers of his free hand and then, at a speed even a Titan's vision could not perceive. With full force, he swung his fist. \"Boom!!!!\" In an instant, the divine body shattered! A tidal wave of force shook the heavens, sending tremors through the divine steel-forged walls, cracking them in multiple places. The sacred temple teetered on the brink of collapse! From this moment on, the celestial realm would exist no more! The people of Amphoreus would no longer endure the tyranny of the heavens! And all of this was made possible by the God-King's mighty blows, no, by a single punch! The distant Titan gods sensed the fall of their comrade and erupted into furious howls. Was there no one who could stop him? How could his advance ever be shaken?? What they did not realize was that even one as mighty as the God-King was still bound by the desires of mortals. Just as before the battle began, he once again adjusted his attire. \"...Congratulations, you have reached your end, Aquila. You are strong, strong enough to be worthy of the name Sky Titan.\" He ignored the crumbling stone walls behind him and strode toward the temple's exit. His steps were steady, yet the disappointment on his face was unmistakable. \"But your only flaw, was failing to make this satisfying for me.\" Next Episode: \"Battling Nikador\" (Next issue on hiatus)"
