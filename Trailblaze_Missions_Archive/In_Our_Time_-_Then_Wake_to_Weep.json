For now, please allow me to call you the \"Trailblazer\".I am sure you have learned of who I am by now... A former Astral Express maintenance engineer, an apprentice of little promise, and an old man who lived an entirely unremarkable existence. I set out on the Trailblazing journey so I might learn about life itself and everything within. However, the more I learned, the more I found myself lost in confusion and distress. I thought that I would be able to learn how to live a better life, but all I learned was how to elegantly face the ending fate has paired you with... \"Nihility\".Everyone in life will eventually find their own answer — to resist or to obey fate — but these questions do not belong to Trailblaze. Although, I fear this question may simply be too profound. I fear evenAkiviliTHEMSELF would not be able to provide a single answer that is unique to Trailblaze. However, as a Nameless... as a person... we have the right to reflect. We have the right to act. We have the right to define our own endings. We have the right to move forward. As we advance down the road to our own ending, there are many things that people are capable of, and our endings will thus take on a completely new meaning. A Nameless does not indulge in temporary dreams, nor would they forsake their birth rights due to pain and suffering.Do you still recall the question I left in my invitation letter, Trailblazer? \"Why does life slumber?\"\"People slumber so that, eventually, they can awaken from their dreams.\" ...This is the answer that an old Nameless devoted his entire life to finding."
