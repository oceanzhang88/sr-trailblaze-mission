The Express will be here, before you're ready to leave. March 7th Great! I'm craving some juice... Pom-Pom still owes me a glass! Dan Heng How is Jarilo-VI ? Welt Not great. Even though the influence of the Stellaron has basically subsided, the existing Fragmentum is too deeply rooted. The Eternal Freeze has lasted a very long time, enough to severely impact the ecology of the planet. In short, the planet probably won't regain the vitality that it once had a thousand years ago in such a short time. March 7th Oh... How could this be? Is there anything else we can do? (Trailblazer) Is there anything else we can do? Welt ...As Trailblazers, our mission has already concluded successfully. The fate of this world should be handed back to its inhabitants. Humankind has always struggled against austere conditions and had always managed to thrive in spite of it. Now that the Eternal Freeze is gone, the Fragmentum has lost its momentum to expand. Jarilo-VI will be revitalized. Believe in the perseverance of her people. I detected a high-frequency spatial energy surge in the north of Jarilo-VI. You might be interested in checking it out. Don't worry. That energy is not related to the Stellaron. It's only an Echo left behind after spatial distortions fade away. Inside the Echo, our perceptions of space and time that we are used to will become radically altered, to the point where it might even reconstruct certain scenes from our own past experiences. If you're in the mood and wish to re-live those memorable adventures, you can try your luck at places where Echoes can be found."
