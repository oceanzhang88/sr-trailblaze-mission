I had intended to visit you at Dewlight Pavilion as soon as possible upon my return, but with the approaching Charmony Festival and your busy schedule, I refrained from troubling you. However, an urgent matter compels me to share something with you immediately. Since my return to Penacony, I have experienced a peculiar change in my voice. At first, I thought it was caused by exhaustion or illness, but after consulting with doctors, they assured me of my perfect health and dismissed my concerns. However, my voice worsened over time, and I even experienced periods of complete voice loss. In order to find answers, I conducted many private investigations (using my idle time out of rehearsals, of course). Eventually, I realized that the Harmony in Penacony is not pure. A discord lurking within has tainted my voice of Harmony, which I believe to be the root cause of my vocal issues. I immediately realized that such levels of interference can only occur if either a powerful external force is pulling the strings, or if a senior member of The Family is involved. Unfortunately, further investigation has led me to the latter conclusion. This is an extremely alarming discovery: A traitor has emerged within The Family in Penacony, and it is highly likely that this person is one of the four family heads. (I trust you implicitly, dear brother, because of our promise). With the Charmony Festival on the horizon, I fear this person intends to impede its progress, or even use the festival for some ulterior motive. At any rate, I suggest you monitor the other family heads while also prioritizing your own safety. You are the only true family member I have left. There is another matter that requires our attention. During my investigation, I learned about the Memory Zone Meme \"Death,\" and my further inquiries led me to believe that the culprit who directed it to cause this series of incidents is likely the aforementioned traitor in The Family. I have collected more clues and am prepared to verify my hypothesis. Rest assured, you can just focus on the preparations for the Charmony Festival. Once I've thoroughly investigated \"Death,\" I'll come and meet you immediately. It won't take too long. Given your heavy workload, please take care of yourself. Don't stay in the Dreamscape all the time. Spend some time in reality when you are free. I've brought some more specialties from other galaxies: Giantmoa pudding tarts from Morillons, wild strawberries from Akonyako (known for their exceptional size and sweetness, which I'm certain you'll enjoy), and almond meringue cream cracknels from Medicia. Don't forget to enjoy them! May Xipe be with us! Your sister, Robin"

Subsequent search and rescue operations proved unsuccessful. Note: This was the first case. Can't tell if anything is wrong. Insufficient investigation? Mouri, a male from Xianzhou , entered a Spheroid in Golden Hour and mysteriously disappeared while the Spheroid was bouncing in air. Later examinations showed no signs of forced entry or exit on the Spheroid. Note: It seems the culprit can ignore physical barriers. Conventional investigation methods feasible? Emaka, a female human, participated in a talent show in the Moment of Scorchsand but accidentally fell off the stage before the judges turned around and disappeared in the shadows below. The footage for that episode of the show has been deleted. Note: The culprit is swift and skilled at disguises. Caution is advised. Weber, a male Pepeshi , fell down when entering his office on payday in Gilded Hour, and was killed by an unknown meme that suddenly appeared. The memories of witnesses have been processed. Note: Preferring to attack wounded or vulnerable individuals? Uncertain. May be taking orders from someone else. Chemmet, a male Pepeshi, was taken away while flipping over a card at a casino in the Moment of Stars. The casino staff has dealt with the aftermath of the incident. Note: Flipping a card. Interesting. Dekem, a male human, jumped into the ocean of dream bubbles in Blue Hour in an attempt to impress his girlfriend but got entangled by an unknown meme under the sea and drowned. His girlfriend's memories have been processed, but the outcomes are not satisfactory. Further intervention from Motivators may be necessary. Note: Most cases are related to the ocean. Could this be a breakthrough? Additional Note: Scratch that. After checking, only two cases were related to the ocean. Caixia, a female Foxian, was engulfed by an unknown meme while playing Dreamy Slots in Golden Hour. The incident caused a huge commotion at the spot. The memories of most witnesses have been processed. Note: Could it be the Sweet Dreams Troupe? Does it have the ability to imitate and learn? Multiple culprits? There is likely a mastermind behind the scenes. Kambega, a male Bloodhound , was attacked by an unknown meme before his shift change in the Moment of Serenity, resulting in his death after a fight. Security measures have been enhanced in the prison area. Note: No notable details in this case. Need to ask the Bloodhound Family to strengthen defenses in the prison and other facilities. Janet, a female human, disappeared while visiting the film history gallery at the museum in the Moment of Sol. She was drawn towards a mysterious sound calling to her and walked into a screen, vanishing without a trace. The site has been cordoned off. Note: This is the only case where the culprit demonstrated speech ability. Further verification is required to determine if this is a false claim. Monk, a male Intellitron , was attacked while replacing his newly purchased high-grade vision sensor in the auction at the Moment of Dusk. Note: Vision sensor? Noteworthy. Annette, a female Pepeshi, vanished while touching up her makeup in the bathroom before the graduation ceremony at Paperfold Academy in the Moment of Sol. She was caught by a meme into a mirror and disappeared, witnessed by a teacher at the scene. Note: Mirror? Noteworthy. Current hypothesis is related to sight. Chloe, a female Intellitron, was attacked by a meme and disappeared when she blew out the candles during her birthday celebration with her friends in Blue Hour. All witnesses are currently receiving treatment from Motivators. Note: More attacks occurred in dark or dim environments. Is \"sight\" really a trigger? Carissa, a female Halovian, was harassed by a fervent fan backstage before her performance in the Moment of Scorchsand and was subsequently abducted by a meme during her escape. The Bloodhound Family has apprehended the fan. Note: Abducted? Keep a lookout for this fervent fan. Dorian, a male human, took a nap before the end of his shift in the Moment of Daybreak without telling his managers and was abducted by an unknown meme hiding under a chair. Emergency intervention was provided, and production at the factory has resumed as usual. Note: Taking a nap? Plus, consider discussing with the Alfalfa Family about increased vacation time and additional breaks for workers. Marlowe, a male human, disappeared after being involved in a car accident in Golden Hour. Witnesses reported the presence of an eerie meme who fled underground at the scene of the accident. Note: This is a genuine case of \"Death.\" The meme must be connected to concepts such as death and murder. ... *This list comprises over a hundred cases related to the Memory Zone Meme \"Death.\" However, the author of the list seems to still struggle with figuring out the pattern."

However, I must remind you that you now hold the position of not only her elder brother but also the head of the Oak Family . Your every action has implications for all of Penacony. As Penacony is going through a critical period, it is crucial that you do not allow your hatred to cloud your judgment, and be cautious not to engage in activities that others can use against you as leverage. I heard that you are planning to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to find \"Death.\" Such action does not serve the best interests of The Family as a whole, and I strongly advise you to reconsider it to avoid potential impeachments from other family heads. While you are convinced that \"Death\" is connected to the Watchmaker , I have met that Watchmaker many times long before the Dreammaster adopted you and your sister, and I have never found any evidence linking him to that Memory Zone Meme. Now that you are the head of the Oak Family, it is essential that you assess the situation objectively and consider the bigger picture. It is unwise to allocate all of Penacony's resources and manpower for the sake of a personal vendetta, as this would bring dishonor to the Great One ! The Charmony Festival is on the horizon, and the Watchmaker's guests are all barely holding back their own agendas. Neither you nor I could face the severe consequences if Dominicus' arrival is delayed. Therefore, I urge you to control your emotions and fulfill your responsibilities as the head of the Oak Family, focusing only on the Festival and avoiding any interference from external sources. In addition, we must not neglect the honored guests invited by the Watchmaker, as mishandling this matter could lead to diplomatic conflicts with other major factions, involving us in disputes that could have been avoided. As your elder, I hope you comprehend the gravity of the situation and handle it appropriately. As for the matter of Robin, there would be time to pursue it once the Festival concludes. By then, I will provide you with the necessary resources and manpower in the name of the Alfalfa Family to help you get your revenge. Additionally, I have heard rumors that the Dreammaster is not entirely pleased with your recent activities. I advise you to conduct yourself with caution. Yours sincerely, Old Oti"
