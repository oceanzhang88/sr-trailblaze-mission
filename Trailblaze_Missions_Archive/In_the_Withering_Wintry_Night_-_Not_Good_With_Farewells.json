I apologize for not telling you of my plan. I was afraid that you would strongly object, which might sway my resolve. Madam Cocolia raised me up, and I will never be able to repay her kindness. She taught me countless life lessons and virtues, as well as how to defend Belobog and its people. Even though she has lately made certain decisions that puzzled me, I can't let go of all the precious memories I have with her. I must communicate my point of view and thoughts to her honestly, and seek to arrive at a mutual understanding with her — this is my goal as a daughter, but also my duty as a Silvermane Guard. But I'm aware of the risks I might face on this journey. So, if I fail to win my mother's approval—or if something happens to me—please forward this letter to the Landau siblings and ask for their help. Serval and Gepard are honorable people with enormous power in Belobog, and I have complete faith in them. I'm sure they will unreservedly help you in your search for the Stellaron once they see my seal and handwriting. Bronya Rand"
