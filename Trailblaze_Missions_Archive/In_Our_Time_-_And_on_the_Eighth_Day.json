Hailing from the Zorina-Urd system — enlightened by Remembrance and dominated by academic cliques — she majored in memoria dynamics. To seek out broader academic possibilities, she joined the crew of the Astral Express to build Asdana and launched her research into memoria. Towards the end of the War of Independence, she piloted a shuttle on her own and disappeared into the Memory Zone in search of secrets about the Primordial Dreamscape. Her research results formed the theoretical basis for the development of the entire Penacony to this day, creating a profound impact on the affluence of later generations. She was the true founder behind the Land of the Dreams. Breukelen Tiernan The former guard of the Astral Express and an outstanding gunslinger. Hailing from the frontier world of Frati, his worship of local legend Oakley the Musketeer saw him board the Astral Express. During the war, he was one of Penacony's most accomplished generals and the sole winner of the Fanghunter Medal — an award conferred by Hanunue himself. While reopening the silver rail with the Lampmoth Family during the civil war, he was ambushed by the Swarm and disappeared only to be rescued by the Galaxy Rangers. He fought in the crusade against Lord Ravager Zulo and managed to survive that gruesome battle, then disappeared out of sight completely. That was until the day a Self-Annihilator found his relics. Truly, he was a pure, noble, and selfless warrior. Mikhail Char Legwork Former mechanic of the Astral Express, and the legendary big shot of Penacony, \"the Watchmaker.\" Hailing from the oceanic planet of Lushaka , he was adopted by legendary seafarers, the Mikhail-Char couple. It was just by happenstance that he boarded the Express, making many travel companions along the way while contributing greatly to the prosperity and development of Penacony. Beyond mechanical repairs, he often humbly claimed to possess few skills, except for his knack for spinning tales. \"The Watchmaker\" was his greatest lie of all, and Penacony's \"Festivities\" was his final lie. He did not want his star to deviate from the path of freedom, so he intended to cleverly employ falsehoods and keep various Paths existing here for a long time. But he was unable to witness Penacony's end. He died a quiet death in a forgotten corner somewhere, with only a handful in attendance at his funeral. In line with the Nameless' tradition, his Crew ticket was returned to the starry seas. Meanwhile, Penacony remains resplendent in its glory, and the child's dream will continue in perpetuity. May This Journey Lead Us Starward"

[(Trailblazer)] rolls a 6. (Trailblazer) What happened next? Aventurine When you guys were unraveling the secrets beneath the Penacony's surface, I already fell into the Primordial Dreamscape. The Preservation 's Cornerstone shielded me from the contamination of the Nihility , but in doing so, it completely shattered to smithereens. Fortunately, I met a Knight of Beauty and narrowly escaped death with his help. [Aventurine] rolls a 1. Aventurine It's your turn. We gotta follow through with this game Casually roll the die (Trailblazer) Easy-peasy [(Trailblazer)] rolls a 2.

Aventurine You're doing great, my friend Aventurine Then, thanks to you lot, all the truths came to light. Topaz and Jade took over the affairs on Penacony, and now I get to enjoy some time off But I've been having various nightmares these past few days, waking up drenched in sweat every single time Thankfully, the IPC has arranged for a Doctor of Chaos to give me a thorough examination, and things have improved That's about it. You're really lucky to get me to tell the whole story Are you losing on purpose? (Trailblazer) I knew you were losing on purpose from the get-go. There's no way you're that unlucky Enjoy losing much? (Trailblazer) Happy losing, huh? You've tricked me again Aventurine The Dreamscape may be a bustling place, but there aren't many 'friends'. I gotta find ways to make do, wouldn't you say? Thanks for helping me through the tough times. Hope I wasn't a bother Guess I'll find fun somewhere else, see ya I'll pass (Trailblazer) I'll pass Aventurine Oh, that's too bad, I thought you'd like it. Never mind, it's not that important anyway Guess I'll find fun somewhere else, see ya"
