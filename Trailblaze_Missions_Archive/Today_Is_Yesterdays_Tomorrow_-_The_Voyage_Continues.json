Go speak to Asta. She's the lead researcher. She's in charge. (You now have permission from Herta) Can I stay at the space station?

So I should board the Express? ▶ Herta: Well, from an objective standpoint, that's the most rational place for you to be. ▶ Herta: First of all, you have somewhere to live. And you'd be under their protection. Also, it'll be a long trip, so you'll have more opportunities to find a way to save yourself from the Stellaron. Lastly, if the Stellaron really explodes, you won't harm too many people around you. Do I have any other choice? ▶ Herta: Oh, how should I know!
